### Day 1: 

##### Problem 1:

[Two_sum.py] (easy)
  [Two_sum.py]: https://github.com/shahriar100/100_days_LeetCode_challenge/blob/master/Day_1/two_sum.py

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

```
return [0, 1]
```





##### Problem 2:

[Reverse_integer.py] (easy)
  [Reverse_integer.py]: https://github.com/shahriar100/100_days_LeetCode_challenge/blob/master/Day_1/reverse_integer.py

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:
```
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:
```
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.






##### Problem 3:

[Palinfrome_number.py] (easy)
  [Palinfrome_number.py]: https://github.com/shahriar100/100_days_LeetCode_challenge/blob/master/Day_1/palinfrome_number.py

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
```
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
```
Input: 10
Output: false
```
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
